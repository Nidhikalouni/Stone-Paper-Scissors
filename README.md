# Stone-Paper-Scissors
#Introduction-
Stone-Paper-Scissors (also known as Rock-Paper-Scissors) is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible outcomes are:

Stone (rock) crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Stone
This project is a basic implementation of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#Features-
Single-player mode against a computer
Real-time game status updates
Intuitive UI with animations

#Technologies Used-
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
The result of the game will be displayed, indicating whether you won, lost, or drew.

By working on this project, i have enhanced my practical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are fundamental for web development.
